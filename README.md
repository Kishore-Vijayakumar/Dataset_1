# üå± AI Plant Disease Detection System

A complete **AI-driven framework** for detecting, analyzing, and recommending treatments for plant diseases using **Traditional AI (Meta-Heuristic Optimization & Reinforcement Learning)** and **Generative AI** techniques.

This project was developed as part of an **AI Data-Driven Application assignment** to demonstrate how multiple AI paradigms can be applied to solve real-world agricultural problems efficiently and ethically.

## üåø Overview

The **AI Plant Disease Detection System** combines **meta-heuristic algorithms**, **reinforcement learning**, and **generative AI** to provide a comprehensive solution for crop health monitoring and treatment recommendation.

### Key Objectives:
- Detect and analyze plant diseases using AI-generated datasets.
- Optimize feature selection using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**.
- Recommend treatment strategies using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.
- Generate disease analysis reports using **Generative AI**.
- Provide **human-centered, ethical, and interpretable AI outputs** for agricultural applications.
